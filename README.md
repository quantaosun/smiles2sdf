## This repo helps to convert SMILES string to a 3D structure such as SDF, PDB. 

You can obatin a SMILES from online database, or from chemdraw, for example ```c1ccccc1``` is the smiles string for benzene.
The repo uses open babel to convert this string into either a SDF or PDB format with 3D coordination. These SDF and PDB file then can be used as the input for docking or molecular dynamic simulations.

To start a simple conversion, click the button below to use it without any installation.
