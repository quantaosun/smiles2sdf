You might often find yourself in a situation where you get a lot of 2D structures or even just some smiles strings.  How could we translate this important structural information to a 3D structure to focus more on an actual task like QSAR building?

I will show you how to utilize Obabel to help you fulfil this goal. Scenarios 1 and 2 should be easy to follow. Scenario 3 requires you have prior knowledge of the CHEMBLE database.

Theoretically, you can use the notebook on your local laptop or computer, but I write these specifically for use on Google Colab, or on Binder.
